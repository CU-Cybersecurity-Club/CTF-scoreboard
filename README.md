The scoreboard for our sweet CTF games.

To run locally, `cd` into the directory where this project is located and run `npm install`. Once npm has installed all the necessary dependencies, run `npm start` and browse to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) (i.e. <a href='http://127.0.0.1:3000' target='_blank'>http://127.0.0.1:3000</a>). Currently this app loads jQuery and Bootstrap using a CDN so you must have an internet connection to run this locally.
